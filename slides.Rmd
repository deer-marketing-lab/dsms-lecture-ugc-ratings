# Some Useful Definitions

.font140[
**User Generated Content**: Content that is generated or created by an internet user who is a consumer of this information or content
]

.font140[
**Social Media**: The online platforms that host this content
]

* Think of these as the working definitions for our course

* People have a tendency to be use these terms relatively interchangeably 
  * (include me as one of the "people")

---
# Why Did Social Media Take off?

Three factors:

* **Digital Social Networks**
  * Structured information flow

* **Machine Intelligence**
  * Recommendations of friends and content over the network

* **Smartphones**
  * "Always on"
  * Feeds our social brain
